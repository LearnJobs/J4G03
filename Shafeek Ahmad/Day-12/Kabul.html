        <h1>Kabul</h1>
        <p>
         The city is believed to have been founded between 2000-1500BC.
         It is mentioned in Hinduism's sacred Rigveda text (ca.1700-1100BC) as a vision of paradise set in the mountains.
         It was an important center of Zoroastrianism and later Buddhism. The city remained of little importance for much of the first three millennia of its existence.
         It was controlled variously by: the Persians, Alexander the Great, the Seleucid Empire, the Mauryan Empire, the Bactrians, various Hellenistic kingdoms, the Sassanid Empire, and by the 5th century AD was its own kingdom known as Kabul-Shahan. 
         This last kingdom before the Islamic conquest built a large wall to protect the city from invasion when the Arabs arrived at the edge of the kingdom; parts of the wall have survived to this day and are visible above ground within the city.
