        <p>
            Dhaka is the capital city of Bangladesh, in southern Asia. Set beside the Buriganga River, it’s at the center of national government, trade and culture.
             The 17th-century old city was the Mughal capital of Bengal, and many palaces and mosques remain.
             American architect Louis Khan’s National Parliament House complex typifies the huge, fast-growing modern metropolis.
