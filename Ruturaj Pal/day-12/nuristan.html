            Nuristan, also spelled as Nurestan or Nooristan (Pashto/Dari: نورستان; Kamkata-vari:[a] Nuriston), is one of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan, located in the eastern part of the country. It is divided into seven districts and is Afghanistan's least populous province, with a population of around 167,000.[2] Parun serves as the provincial capital. Nuristan is bordered on the south by Laghman and Kunar provinces, on the north by Badakhshan province, on the west by Panjshir province.

It was formerly called Kafiristan (Pashto: كافرستان) ("Land of the Infidels") until the inhabitants were forcibly converted from an animist religion;[3] a form of ancient Hinduism infused with local variations,[4] to Islam in 1895, and thence the region has become known as Nuristan ("land of illumination", or "land of light").[5] The region was located in an area surrounded by Buddhist civilizations which were later taken over by Muslims.[6] The origin of the local Nuristani people has been disputed, ranging from being the indigenous inhabitants forced to flee to this region after refusing to surrender to Muslim invaders, to being linked to various ancient groups of people and the Turk Shahi kings.[7][8]

The primary occupations are agriculture, animal husbandry, and day labor. Located on the southern slopes of the Hindu Kush mountains in the northeastern part of the country, Nuristan spans the basins of the Alingar, Pech, Landai Sin, and Kunar rivers. Most of Nuristan is covered by mountainous forests and it has a rich biodiversity with a domestically unique monsoon climate by air coming from the Indian Ocean.[9] As of 2020, the entirety of Nuristan is now a protected national park.[10][11]
