ASSIGNMENT-26 (07-05-2022)
    1.  Create a SolarSystem class with 2 dependencies. The first one is the Earth and the second one is the
        Jupiter dependency. Both the dependency classes contain the diameter() method and the sufaceArea() method.
        The diameter method and sufaceArea() method prints the diameter and the surface area of there respective planet.

        Use beans.xml file to create the objects. Write a Sun class where the main() method is defined. Call
        the main method to execute the program.

        Create the autowiring by defining the autowire attribute in the corresponding bean.

                    Diameter                Surface-Area
        Earth       12,742 km               510.1 million km²
        Jupiter     139,820 km              61.42 billion km²

    2.  There are 3 dependencies in the name America, Asia & Europe defined within the World class.
        Write method noOfCountries() with the dependency classes. Call the methods from a LivingPlanet class
        main() method.

        Use annotations instead beans.xml.
