    1.  Create a project to find the largest number within an array of numbers.
        =   Use Spring frame work to develop the project
        =   The program must be loosely coupled
        =   There must be a SortAlgorithm dependency object
        =   The sort algorithm may be of different types like:
            >   Bubble Sort.
            >   Recursive Bubble Sort
            >   Insertion Sort
            >   Recursive Insertion Sort
            >   Merge Sort
            >   Iterative Merge Sort
            >   Quick Sort
        =   You don't need to develop the programs for the above sort algorithm.
            Only create the structure of the program.
