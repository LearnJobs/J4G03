    <h2>Sarajevo</h2>
    <hr>
   <P>Sarajevo is the political, financial, social and cultural center of Bosnia and Herzegovina and a prominent center of culture in the Balkans, with region-wide influence in entertainment, media, fashion and the arts.[8][9] Due to its long history of religious and cultural diversity, Sarajevo is sometimes called the "Jerusalem of Europe"[1] or "Jerusalem of the Balkans".[2] It is one of only a few major European cities to have a mosque, Catholic church, Orthodox church and synagogue within the same neighborhood.[10]
