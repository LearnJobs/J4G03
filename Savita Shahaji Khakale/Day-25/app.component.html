Maharashtra  is a state in the western peninsular region of India occupying a substantial portion 
of the Deccan Plateau. Maharashtra is the second-most populous state in India and the second-most 
populous country subdivision globally. It was formed on 1 May 1960 by splitting the bilingual Bombay 
State, which had existed since 1956, into majority Marathi-speaking Maharashtra and Gujarati-speaking 
Gujarat. Maharashtra is home to the Marathi people, the predominant ethno-linguistic group, who speak 
the Marathi language, the official language of the state. The state is divided into 6 divisions and 36 
districts, with the state capital being Mumbai, the most populous urban area in India, and Nagpur serving
 as the winter capital, which also hosts the winter session of the state legislature.[9] Godavari and Krishna 
are the two major rivers in the state. Forests cover 16.47 per cent of the state's geographical area. Out of 
the total cultivable land in the state, about 60 per cent is used for grain crops in the Deccan region, rice 
in coastal Konkan, and other high rainfall areas.
